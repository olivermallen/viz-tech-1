        <h1>Cottagecore To Tradwife Pipeline</h1>
        <h2>Demonstrated with hashtags on Tumblr</h2>
        <p>
            My dataset is a collection of posts from the popular blogging platform Tumblr. These posts have been collected based on hashtags, 
            and the hashtags collected were “#cottagecore”, “#tradfem”, “#tradwife”, and “#tradblr”. This dataset was collected as part of another 
            project to model the “Cottagecore to Tradwife Pipeline”, which is a potential route to extremism through overlapping imagery. Cottagecore 
            is an internet-based aesthetic that revolves around a romanticized rural lifestyle, which is shared through social media postings. Traditional 
            Feminists (Tradwives, Tradfems, etc) are a sect of conservative women who ascribe to conservative values, traditional gender roles, and often 
            white supremacy. Both of these demographics post on Tumblr, and because they have overlapping interests like baking, homemaking, and gardening 
            they can end up using the same hashtags. The consumption of content related to cottagecore can lead to accidentally stumbling into spaces where 
            conservative women discuss their hobbies of canning, sewing, gardening as well as their political views, which is called the “Cottagecore to Tradwife Pipeline”.

            In order to visualize this story I want to use the martini glass structure, which will allow me to tell an introductory story about the cottagecore to 
            tradwife pipeline and then leave the visualization open to the reader to explore other related hashtags. I plan to use a consistent visual platform to 
            bring unity to the visualization. Because I have information about post time I want to construct a line graph. This way I can show the popularity of different hashtags posted with tradwife content over time, including a 
            timeline slider. I will start my visualization by showing how many tradwife blogs also post the cottagecore tag, and then I will leave it to the viewer to 
            discover other potential pipelines. I would also like to add details on demand to allow viewers to navigate to specific blogs or posts to explore further. 
            Lots of social media data visualizations are aggregated which can cause loss of detail/nuance, so this approach will allow viewers to actually read some of the 
            content represented in the visual. I will use Markers of Interactivity to show how users can interact with the visualization. I want to make the legend a network 
            of tags to show relationships between them.
