        <h3>What is Cottagecore?</h3>
        <p>
            Cottagecore is "an internet based aesthetic that revolves around a romanticized rural lifestyle, which is shared through social media postings" 
            <a href=" https://cedar.wwu.edu/wwu_honors/531/">(Waller 2022)</a>. 
            Some typical Cottagecore imagery can be seen above, including rural scenery, feminine dress, lush gardens, and more. This aesthetic embodies 
            a desire to get away from the harsh realities of modern life, and it contains themes of queer escapism <a href=" https://cedar.wwu.edu/wwu_honors/531/">(Waller 2022)</a>. These idealized rural aesthetics become a 
            setting for a queer lifestyle free from homophobia and the strict stereotypes enforced by society, reminiscent of lesbian escapism <a href="https://www.koliaza.com/publication/barbeau-2022-transaesthetics/barbeau-2022-transaesthetics.pdf
            ">(Barbeau 2022)</a>. This aesthetic is 
            also associated with anti-capitalism, revaluing hobbies that have historically been considered feminine like homemaking, baking, gardening, and sewing. Instead of focusing on 
            making money, Cottagecore emphasises doing these hobbies for enjoyment and as a way to be more sustainable, and sharing these hobbies with others <a href=" https://cedar.wwu.edu/wwu_honors/531/">(Waller 2022</a>, <a href="https://www.koliaza.com/publication/barbeau-2022-transaesthetics/barbeau-2022-transaesthetics.pdf
            ">, Barbeau 2022)</a>.
            Despite the feminine aesthetics associated with Cottagecore this online movement is available to anyone no matter their gender identity or sexual orientation <a href=" https://cedar.wwu.edu/wwu_honors/531/">(Waller 2022)</a>. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Cottagecore is not without its criticisms, and the desire to return to a “traditional” agrarian life is often framed
            within the white-centric imagery of homesteading and farming. Posts also heavily feature white, thin, conventionally attractive women, and the movement simplifies the reality of rural life, especially for minorities <a href="https://www.koliaza.com/publication/barbeau-2022-transaesthetics/barbeau-2022-transaesthetics.pdf

        <h3>What is a Tradwife?</h3>
        <p>
            Traditional Feminists (also knows as Tradwifes, Tradfems, etc.) are a sect of conservative women who subscribe to conservative values, traditional gender 
            roles, and often white supremacy <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/01/opinion/sunday/tradwives-women-alt-right.html">(Kelley 2018)</a>. Traditional Feminism is a set of values and philosophies designed to "win over" women and get them to 
            join alt-right communities <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/01/opinion/sunday/tradwives-women-alt-right.html">(Kelley 2018)</a>. They value the same feminine hobbies seen in Cottagecore, like homemaking, but Tradwives emphasize the role 
            of the husband in these activities and perform them to serve a partner or be a good wife <a href=" https://cedar.wwu.edu/wwu_honors/531/">(Waller 2022)</a>. Some tradwives also "extol the virtues of 
            staying at home, submitting to male leadership and bearing lots of children," which has ties to eugenics and the goal of furthering the white 
            race <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/01/opinion/sunday/tradwives-women-alt-right.html">(Kelley 2018)</a>. Annie Kelly, a Ph.D. student at the University of East Anglia researching the impact of digital cultures on anti-feminism and the 
            far-right, says “the seemingly anachronistic way they (traditional feminists) dress is no accident. The deliberately hyper-feminine aesthetics are 
            constructed precisely to mask the authoritarianism of their ideology,” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/01/opinion/sunday/tradwives-women-alt-right.html">(Kelley 2018)</a>.

        <h3>What is the Cottagecore to Tradwife Pipeline?</h3>
        <p>
            According to Barbeau et al. “The consumption of content related to Cottagecore can lead to accidentally stumbling into conservative spaces — which is often
             called the “Tradwife pipeline” — where conservative women discuss their hobbies of canning, sewing, gardening as well as their political views, while 
             sharing pretty images and  DIY tips,”<a href="https://www.koliaza.com/publication/barbeau-2022-transaesthetics/barbeau-2022-transaesthetics.pdf
            ">(Barbeau 2022)</a>. As seen in figure \ref{fig:search_tumblr}, the imagery and hobbies adopted by both groups can 
             lead to an overlap of posts containing things like canning, gardening, and traditional feminism. Presumably this overlap of imagery might cause some 
             users to be exposed to alt-right ideas, potentially leading to offline consequences <a href="https://content.iospress.com/articles/international-journal-of-developmental-science/dev170233">(Hassan 2018)</a>. It could also result in users who are intending 
             to reblog “cottagecore” content accidentally amplifying the websites, products, or views of tradwife bloggers. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The far-left nature of Cottagecore users may also make them more vulnerable to alt-right content, as disaffected individuals who are already interested 
            in divesting from cultural norms may be more easily introduced to right-leaning extremism.
