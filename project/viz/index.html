        <p>This plot includes posts tagged #tradwife, #tradfem, or #tradblr collected from 2019-2022. These tags are tags often used by tradwife posters on tumblr, 
            a popular microblogging site where Barbeau et. al. identified the Cottagecore to Tradwife Pipeline. </p>
        <p>The network shows which tags are being used by these tradwife blogs. Two tags are connected if they are 
            often posted together, and the larger tags are posted more often. You can see the “landscape” of topics that tradwife 
            blogs post about in this network. By clicking on a tag you can see how often this tag appears in tradwife posts over time. 
            Here we can see that “cottagecore” was peaked in April 2022, so Tumblr users searching the cottagecore tag at this time may 
            have been exposed to tradwife content or accidentally amplified tradwife views. </p>
